SALES – Date, Order_id, Item_id, Customer_id, Quantity, Revenue

ITEMS – Item_id, Item_name, Price, Department

CUSTOMERS - Customer_id, First_name, Last_name, Address



Pull total number of orders that were completed on 18th March 2023

```sql
SELECT count(distinct order_id)
FROM sales
WHERE date = "03-18-2023";
```



Pull total number of orders that were completed on 18th March 2023 with the first name ‘John’ and last name ‘Doe’

```SQL
SELECT count(distinct order_id)
FROM sales JOIN customers
ON sales.customer_id = customers.customer_id
WHERE sales.date = "03-18-2023" AND customers.first_name = "John" AND customers.last_name = "Doe";
```



Pull total number of customers that purchased in January 2023 and the average amount spend per customer

```sql
SELECT count(distinct customer_id), sum(revenue)/count(distinct customer_id) as avg_per_customer
FROM sales
WHERE cast(sales.date AS str) like "01-%-2023"
```



Pull the departments that generated less than $600 in 2022

```sql
SELECT items.department, COALESCE(sum(sales.revenue), 0) as rev
FROM items LEFT JOIN sales
ON sales.item_id = items.item_id
WHERE cast(sales.date AS str) like "%-%-2022";
GROUP BY 1
HAVING rev < 600;
```



What is the most and least revenue we have generated by an order?

```sql
SELECT min(rev), max(rev)
FROM (SELECT sum(revenue) as rev
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY order_id) as t;
```



What were the orders that were purchased in our most lucrative order?

I assumed by "orders in the most lucrative order", you meant "**sales** in the most lucrative order"

```sql
SELECT *
FROM sales JOIN (SELECT oid, max(order_profit)
    FROM (SELECT oid, sum(profit) as order_profit
        FROM (SELECT sales.order_id as oid, sales.revenue - sales.quantity * items.price as profit
            FROM sales JOIN items
            ON sales.item_id = items.item_id) as t0
        GROUP BY oid) as t1) as t2
ON t2.oid = sales.order_id;
```
