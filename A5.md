1. How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?

   We use p-value. The result is considered of statistical significance (or strong against null hypothesis, less occur by chance) when the p-value is below the significance level (usually 5%).

2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?

   When the number of sample groups and the the sample size get larger, the distribution of the mean of the samples will gets closer to normal distribution.

3. What is the statistical power?

   The likelihood of a hypothesis test detecting a true effect if there is one

4. How do you control for biases?

   A broad question. Generally speaking:

   1. use large and representative sample
   2. choose reliable testing methods for the study (like don't use z-test on small samples)
   3. be objective and try to avoid confirmation bias and consider Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

5. What are confounding variables?

   When we try to establish the relationship between two variables A and B, confounding variables are the third party that affects both A and B, and hence compromises the result.

6. What is A/B testing?

   A test method to know whether a change is desirable or not in your products. It consists of two versions of your products. All the elements of the two versions are the same except for the one variable that we want to compare.

7. What are confidence intervals?

   A range of estimates for an unknown parameter. It is an attempt to quantify the uncertainty or variability
